# rHardwareSleuth
A script to monitor new posts to r/hardwareswap for given keywoards (ie hardware that i want to purchase) and then notify me about those threads in a timely manner.

rHWS.py - A script to monitor subreddits for given keywords and then notify the
user of new threads matching any of the keywords. This was specifically created to monitor r/HardwareSwap for computer compents that I want to purchase but always seem to be to late to find. This is also meant to be a learning project aimed at teaching myself how to interact with resources on the internet using third party API's. It will initially use praw but may later transition to manually using the reddit API, not because its a better way to do this, but because it will provide me with a greater learning experience.
